# AnimatePresence Learning Checklist

Use this checklist to track your progress in understanding and applying AnimatePresence concepts.

## Core Concepts

- [ ] Understand that AnimatePresence enables exit animations for components being removed from the DOM
- [ ] Recognize that AnimatePresence must wrap the conditionally rendered components
- [ ] Learn the difference between `initial`, `animate`, and `exit` properties
- [ ] Understand the importance of the `key` prop for identifying components

## Basic Implementation

- [ ] Create a component that uses AnimatePresence to animate elements in/out
- [ ] Implement conditional rendering inside AnimatePresence
- [ ] Define proper exit animations
- [ ] Test that the component animates correctly when conditions change

## Advanced Features

- [ ] Experiment with the `mode` prop ("wait" vs "sync")
- [ ] Use staggered animations with multiple children
- [ ] Apply layout animations in combination with AnimatePresence
- [ ] Implement shared layout animations between different states

## Practical Applications

- [ ] Build a form with conditional fields
- [ ] Create a tabbed interface with animated transitions
- [ ] Implement a modal dialog with entrance/exit animations
- [ ] Develop a multi-step form wizard with transitions

## Debugging & Optimization

- [ ] Identify and fix common issues (missing keys, incorrect animation flow)
- [ ] Optimize animations for performance
- [ ] Handle edge cases (rapid state changes, interrupted animations)
- [ ] Learn to debug animation timing issues

## Project Completion

- [ ] Combine AnimatePresence with other Motion features
- [ ] Create a polished UI component that uses AnimatePresence effectively
- [ ] Document your implementation and lessons learned
- [ ] Share your component with others for feedback
